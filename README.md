> API service
  - which takes github url and returns a ledgible summary
  - what it does, what tech is used, how it's structured

> Tech Stack
  - Fast API or flask
  - Nebius Token Factory API or an alternative LLM provider

> End Point
  - Accepts a GitHub repository URL, fetches the repository contents, and returns a summary generated by an LLM.

  - Input:
  {
    "github_url": "https://github.com/psf/requests"
  }

  - Output:
    - Scenario 1
  {
    "summary": "**Requests** is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests...",
    "technologies": ["Python", "urllib3", "certifi"],
    "structure": "The project follows a standard Python package layout with the main source code in `src/requests/`, tests in `tests/`, and documentation in `docs/`."
  }
    - Scenario 2
      {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "Description of what went wrong"
      }


> Key Challenges
  - KEY: How you handle the repo content before sending them to the LLM
    - You can't just send everything to the LLM
    - Which files can be ignored
    - There is a limited context window
    - What gives the LLM the best understanding: README, Directory tree, key source files, config files
