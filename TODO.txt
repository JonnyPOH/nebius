  - Deciding which files are important
  - LLM only has a limited context window
  - What gives the LLM the best understanding: README, directory tree, key source file, config files

> Running the code
  - README should have step be step instructions to install dependencies and start the server
  - After following, the server starts and exposes POST/ summarize
  - Can be tested by 'curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/summarize \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{"github_url": "https://github.com/psf/requests"}'
